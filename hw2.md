##The TrainingLab

Consider the following spec...

The TrainingLab is a new software development training centre offering a number of courses in programming and computer science. Students can enrol on a module and will be asked to submit multiple project assignments which contribute to their final grade.

Projects are graded as follows:

\>90% - A+

80-89% - A

75-79% - B+

70-74% - B

60-69% - C

\<60% - F

The TrainingLab currently store student data and project grades in a spreadsheet but would like to be able to store and process this data more efficiently.

They would like to be able to view personal details for each student, to view a list of students enrolled on each module, to be able to grade a project and calculate a student's final grade for the module by taking an average across each of their projects. It would also be useful to sort students from highest grade to lowest grade.

A sample of the data is provided below:

| Student ID | Student Name | Email | Module ID | Module Name | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 104 | Bob | justbob@gmail.com | 36 | Operating Systems | 65.0 | 78.2 | 87.2 |
| 187 | Alice | alice_rocz@gmail.com | 47 | Database Management | 43.2 | 35.4 | 64.3 |
| 192 | Chris | chris365@yahoo.co.uk | 47 | Database Management | 78.2 | 86.8 | 95.4 |

Who are the potential users of this system and what are their actions?

Can you identify the objects, attributes and methods that would need to be implemented to meet these requirements?

What interactions exist between the various objects? 

Provide a use case diagram to define 3 potential use cases of this domain.

Provide a class diagram to model the properties, object and interactions in this domain.
